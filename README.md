# IPC Basics
All programs were written for Linux machines.
### Semaphors
Two programs that synchronise each other to print a pyramid of numbers (one program prints even numbers, the other odd ones).
```
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
...
```
The effect is achieved using semaphors.

### Queues
Same as semaphors, but message queues are used.

### Memories
Simple shared memory example that stores a number and a string.\
Input checking implemented.
